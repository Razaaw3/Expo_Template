## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your local machine.
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) installed globally.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed (for dependency management).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Razaaw3/Expo_Template.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
  ```bash
   cd Expo_Template
  ```
3. Install the project dependencies:
  ```bash
   yarn
  ```
### Usage
To start the development server and run the Expo application, use the following command:
 ```bash
   npx expo
 ```
This will open the Expo DevTools. You can then choose to run the app on an iOS or Android emulator/simulator or on a physical device by scanning the QR code.

### Updating Dependencies
To update all project dependencies, you can use the following command:
 ```bash
   yarn upgrade
 ```
Additionally, you can ensure that you have the correct package versions by running:
 ```bash
   npx expo install --fix
 ```
### Folder Structure
The project is structured as follows:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Fonts/         # Contains fonts assets
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
